        <p>Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts,who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern
          France, celebrated their new year on November 1. </p>

        <p>
          This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of
          year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year,
          the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31
          they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of the otherworldly
          spirits made it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about the future. For a
          people entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, these prophecies were an important source of
          comfort during the long, dark winter.
        </p>

        <p>
          To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops and
          animals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes, typically
          consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other’s fortunes.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier that
          evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="columns_2">
            <p>Ancient Celts marked Samhain as the most significant of the four quarterly fire festivals, taking place
              at the midpoint between the fall equinox and the winter solstice. During this time of year, hearth fires
              in family homes were left to burn out while the harvest was gathered.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the harvest work was complete, celebrants joined with Druid priests to light a community fire
              using a wheel that would cause friction and spark flames. The wheel was considered a representation of
              the sun and used along with prayers. Cattle were sacrificed, and participants took a flame from the
              communal bonfire back to their home to relight the hearth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Early texts present Samhain as a mandatory celebration lasting three days and three nights where the
              community was required to show themselves to local kings or chieftains. Failure to participate was
              believed to result in punishment from the gods, usually illness or death.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was also a military aspect to Samhain in Ireland, with holiday thrones prepared for commanders of
              soldiers. Anyone who committed a crime or used their weapons during the celebration faced a death
              sentence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some documents mention six days of drinking alcohol to excess, typically mead or beer, along with
              gluttonous feasts.

    <!--CHRISTIANITY-->

        <h1>CHRISTIANITY INVADES</h1>
        <p>On May 13, 609 A.D., Pope Boniface IV dedicated the Pantheon in Rome in honor of all Christian martyrs,
          and the Catholic feast of All Martyrs Day was established in the Western church. Pope Gregory III later
          expanded the festival to include all saints as well as all martyrs, and moved the observance from May 13
          to November 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the 9th century, the influence of Christianity had spread into Celtic lands, where it gradually
          blended with and supplanted older Celtic rites. In 1000 A.D., the church made November 2 All Souls’ Day,
          a day to honor the dead. It’s widely believed today that the church was attempting to replace the Celtic
          festival of the dead with a related, church-sanctioned holiday.
        </p>

        <p>
          All Souls’ Day was celebrated similarly to Samhain, with big bonfires, parades and dressing up in
          costumes as saints, angels and devils. The All Saints’ Day celebration was also called All-hallows or
          All-hallowmas (from Middle English Alholowmesse meaning All Saints’ Day) and the night before it, the
          traditional night of Samhain in the Celtic religion, began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, eventually,
          Halloween.

    <!--TRICK OR TREATING-->

    <section class="trickortreat">
      <h1>TRICK OR TREATING</h1>
      <p>Borrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking
        for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition. Young women
        believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband by doing
        tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and
        neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn of the century, Halloween
        parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. Parties focused on
        games, foods of the season and festive costumes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Parents were encouraged by newspapers and community leaders to take anything “frightening” or
        “grotesque” out of Halloween celebrations. Because of these efforts, Halloween lost most of its
        superstitious and religious overtones by the beginning of the twentieth century.

    <!--COMING TO AMERICA-->

    <section class="america">
      <h1>COMING TO AMERICA</h1>
      <p>The celebration of Halloween was extremely limited in colonial New England because of the rigid
        Protestant belief systems there. Halloween was much more common in Maryland and the southern colonies.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the beliefs and customs of different European ethnic groups and the American Indians meshed, a
        distinctly American version of Halloween began to emerge. The first celebrations included “play
        parties,” which were public events held to celebrate the harvest. Neighbors would share stories of the
        dead, tell each other’s fortunes, dance and sing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Colonial Halloween festivities also featured the telling of ghost stories and mischief-making of all
        kinds. By the middle of the 19th century, annual autumn festivities were common, but Halloween was not
        yet celebrated everywhere in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the second half of the 19th century, America was flooded with new immigrants. These new immigrants,
        especially the millions of Irish fleeing the Irish Potato Famine, helped to popularize the celebration
        of Halloween nationally.

    <!--MODERN DAY-->

    <section class="modern">
      <h1>MODERN DAY</h1>
      <p>By the 1950s Halloween became a holiday that was primarily for the children. Trick-or-treating was
        commonplace as kids went around their neighborhoods in costume collecting candy. Halloween became
        increasingly embedded in popular culture and horror movies would often be released to coincide with the
        holiday. Movies such as “Nightmare on Elm Street,” “Halloween,” and “Friday the 13th” have all become
        classics associated with the holiday.
      </p>

      <p>
        Halloween is now America’s second-largest commercial holiday, with $6 billion being spent on it each
        year. Numerous traditions such as trick-or-treating, costume parties, and watching horror movies all
        contribute towards a huge occasion that is celebrated throughout the country.
